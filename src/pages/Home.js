            <h1>Welcome to Bluewater Zoo and Aquariums</h1>
            <p>Bluewater Zoo is a specialty store that caters to exotic fish and reptiles. We have a particularly strong
                interest in aquariums and their inhabitants and try, whenever possible, to encourage the most natural
                methodologies in effort to create mini ecosystems. In fact, we offer the best selection of fish and
                reptiles in the area... by a long shot! Bluewater Zoo is locally owned and family run business that's
                continually growing. We need your help to decide which products, and what direction, to take. We are all
                ears!</p>
